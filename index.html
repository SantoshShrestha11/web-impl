  <!-- noopener: The noopener attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the -->
  <!-- original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security -->
  <!-- risk. -->
  <!-- Without noopener, the new tab could use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe. -->

  <!-- noreferrer: The noreferrer attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where -->
  <!-- the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from -->
  <!-- accessing the original page. -->
  <!-- Why do we need this added behaviour for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it. -->

  <!-- In this example: target=”_blank”: opens the link in a new tab. rel=”noreferrer”: ensures the new page cannot see the referring page’s address (privacy) and prevents it from accessing the original page (security). -->
